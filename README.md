This is the codebase for our paper " Flexible Joint Sparse Representation: Enhancing Multimodal Biometric Verification Accuracy and Anti-Spoofing". 

In this experiment, the CNN feature extraction method uses ResNet50. The following are the environment setup methods:

Create a virtual environment

conda create -n Resnet50_env python=3.11 -y


Install the necessary environment

pip install numpy
pip install torch
pip install torchvision
pip install matplotlib
